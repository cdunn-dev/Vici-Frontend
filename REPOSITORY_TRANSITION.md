## Development Guidelines

### Do's
- Always clone from the new monorepo
- Use the appropriate package structure for your code
- Share code via the shared package when possible
- Keep backend and frontend concerns separated
- Ensure cross-package changes are atomic

### Don'ts
- Don't clone or reference deprecated repositories
- Don't copy code from old repositories
- Don't create new features in deprecated repositories
- Don't maintain multiple copies of shared code
- Don't mix backend and frontend concerns within packages

## Getting Started

1. Clone the new repository:
```bash
# Monorepo
git clone https://github.com/cdunn-dev/Vici-App.git
cd Vici-App
```

2. Install dependencies:
```bash
yarn install
```

3. Start development:
```bash
# Frontend - Web
yarn web:dev

# Frontend - Mobile
yarn mobile:dev

# Backend - API
yarn api:dev
```
