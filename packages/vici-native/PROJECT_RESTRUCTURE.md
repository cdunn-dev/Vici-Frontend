# iOS Project Restructuring

## Problem Statement

The original ViciMVP iOS project had excessive nesting in its directory structure:
```
packages/vici-native/ViciMVP/ViciMVP/ViciMVP/
```

This triple-nested structure created several issues:
1. Confusing navigation for developers
2. Potential file reference issues in Xcode
3. Non-standard project layout making onboarding difficult
4. Maintenance challenges as the codebase grows

## Solution

We've restructured the iOS project to follow standard iOS development practices with a clean, logical directory hierarchy:

```
ViciMVP_New/
├── Sources/                # All Swift source code
│   ├── Models/             # Data models
│   ├── Services/           # Network and business logic services
│   ├── Views/              # UI components and screens
│   ├── ViewModels/         # View models for SwiftUI
│   ├── Utilities/          # Helper classes and extensions
│   └── Mocks/              # Mock data for development and testing
├── Resources/              # Non-code resources
│   └── Info.plist          # App configuration
└── Tests/                  # Test code
    ├── Unit/               # Unit tests
    └── UI/                 # UI tests
```

## Restructuring Process

The restructuring process involved the following steps:

1. **Backup Creation**: Created a backup of the original project structure
2. **New Structure Setup**: Created a clean directory structure following iOS best practices
3. **File Migration**: Moved Swift files to their appropriate locations
4. **Resource Configuration**: Created necessary metadata files like Info.plist
5. **Xcode Project Setup**: Created a new Xcode project file with proper references
6. **Documentation**: Created README and documentation to explain the structure

## Files Migrated

We successfully migrated 17 Swift files:

- 5 Model files
- 1 Service file
- 5 View files
- 3 Mock files
- 3 Test files

## Completed Steps

1. ✅ **Created New Project Structure**: Set up the standard iOS project hierarchy
2. ✅ **Migrated Source Files**: Moved all Swift files to their proper locations
3. ✅ **Created Xcode Project**: Generated project.pbxproj and workspace files
4. ✅ **Resource Configuration**: Created Info.plist and Assets.xcassets
5. ✅ **Documentation**: Added comprehensive README and documentation

## Next Steps

To complete the restructuring:

1. **Open in Xcode**: Open the project in Xcode to verify the structure
2. **Build and Test**: Build the project and ensure it compiles
3. **Deployment Configuration**: Verify signing and deployment settings
4. **Swap Directories**: After verification, replace the original ViciMVP with ViciMVP_New

## Benefits

This restructuring provides several benefits:

1. **Improved Developer Experience**: Clearer navigation and organization
2. **Better Maintainability**: Files organized by function
3. **Easier Onboarding**: Standard structure familiar to iOS developers
4. **Future-Proofing**: Structure that scales as the app grows

## Implementation Notes

The restructuring was performed via a combination of terminal commands and file editing to ensure all files were properly copied while maintaining their content integrity. The Xcode project file was carefully constructed to match the new directory structure while preserving all the build settings from the original project.
