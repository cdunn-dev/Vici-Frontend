# Setting up ViciNative in Xcode

Follow these steps to set up a new Xcode project for the ViciNative app:

1. Open Xcode
2. Create new project (File > New > Project...)
3. Select iOS App
4. Enter the details:
   - Product Name: ViciNative
   - Interface: SwiftUI
   - Life Cycle: SwiftUI App
   - Language: Swift
   - Select "None" for storage (not Core Data)

5. Save the project in: /Users/chrisdunn/Documents/GitHub/Vici-App/packages/vici-native/ios/ViciNative/

6. After the project is created, add the existing Swift files:
   - Right-click on the ViciNative group in the Project Navigator
   - Select "Add Files to 'ViciNative'..."
   - Select all the Swift files in the ViciNative folder (MockData.swift, ViciNativeApp.swift, AuthenticationView.swift, MainTabView.swift)
   - Make sure "Copy items if needed" is NOT selected (files are already in the right location)
   - Click "Add"

7. Delete any auto-generated placeholder files:
   - ViciNativeApp.swift (it will be replaced by our custom one)
   - ContentView.swift (not needed)

8. Build and run the project (âŒ˜R)

If you encounter any build issues, make sure that:
1. The @main attribute only appears in ViciNativeApp.swift
2. All required files are included in the project target
3. There are no duplicate declarations of structures or classes
