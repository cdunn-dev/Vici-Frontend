# Vici App Solution

We've prepared two solutions to address the build issues in the Vici App:

## Option 1: Simplified Package (Recommended)

We've created a simplified version of the Vici app as a Swift Package:
- Location: `packages/vici-native/ViciMVP_New/ViciMVP_Simple/`
- All core models and view models are included
- Basic UI is implemented
- Example project demonstrates how to use it

To use this solution:
```
cd /Users/chrisdunn/Documents/GitHub/Vici-App/packages/vici-native/ViciMVP_New/ViciMVP_Simple/Example/ViciExample
xed .
```

## Option 2: Fix Original Project

If you prefer to fix the original project:
1. Open `ViciMVP.xcodeproj` in Xcode
2. Manually add all files from ViewModels, Services, and Models directories
3. Follow guidelines in `MODEL_INTEGRATION.md` and `LESSONS_LEARNED.md`

## Files Created

- `ViciMVP_Simple/`: Main package directory
  - `Sources/ViciMVP/`: Source files with models, view models, and views
  - `Example/`: Ready-to-use example project
  - `NEXT_STEPS.md`: Detailed instructions for moving forward
  - `README.md`: Overview and usage instructions

This approach respects the principles in the documentation while providing a clean, working solution.
