# Mock to Real Data Transition: Summary of Work

## Overview

This document summarizes the work completed and remaining tasks for transitioning the Vici app from mock data implementations to real API-backed models.

## Completed Work

1. **Created Preview Extensions for Real Models:**
   - `Workout+Preview.swift`: Provides sample workouts for UI previews with the real `Workout` model
   - `TrainingPlan+Preview.swift`: Provides sample training plans for UI previews with the real `TrainingPlan` model
   - `Activity+Preview.swift`: Provides sample activities for UI previews with the real `Activity` model
   - `User+Preview.swift`: Provides sample user data for UI previews with the real `User` model

2. **Created Migration Documentation:**
   - `MOCK_TO_REAL_MIGRATION.md`: Comprehensive guide for developers to transition their code

3. **Deprecated Mock Data:**
   - Added prominent deprecation notice to `MockData.swift` to discourage new usage

4. **Created `ViciResponse` Model:**
   - Implemented the real model for handling AI coach responses

## Services Already Using Real Models

The following services were already properly implemented with real data models:

1. **TrainingService**: Uses async/await methods to fetch real data from the API
2. **AuthService**: Handles authentication and user data with real API
3. **APIClient**: Properly configured to make requests to the backend

## Remaining Tasks

1. **Update View References:**
   - Replace references to `MockWorkout` with `Workout`
   - Replace references to `MockTrainingPlan` with `TrainingPlan` 
   - Replace references to `MockActivity` with `Activity`
   
2. **Update View Models:**
   - Ensure all view models are using real data models and services
   
3. **Testing:**
   - Verify that real API data is properly displayed in all views
   - Ensure all previews work correctly with the new preview extensions
   
4. **Final Cleanup:**
   - Once all references are updated, remove the `MockData.swift` file

## Implementation Strategy

The transition should be gradual, starting with the most critical views:

1. First, update the home view and training plan views
2. Then, update profile and activity-related views
3. Finally, update any remaining supporting views

For each view:
1. Change the model type references (e.g., `MockWorkout` â†’ `Workout`)
2. Update property accesses to match the real model structure
3. Update preview providers to use the new preview extensions
4. Test to verify proper display and functionality

## Addressing Common Issues

During this transition, expect these common issues:

1. **Property Mismatches**: Real models may have different property names or structures
2. **Optional Properties**: Real API models have more optional properties than mock ones
3. **Preview Data**: Existing previews using mock data need to be updated

## Timeline

This work should be prioritized as it's blocking other tasks and causing compilation issues. The suggested timeline is:

- **Immediate**: Update the Home and Training Plan views
- **Short-term (1-2 days)**: Update all remaining views
- **Medium-term (3-5 days)**: Complete testing and validation
- **Long-term (1 week)**: Final cleanup and removal of mock data

## Conclusion

The transition from mock to real data is a critical step in preparing the Vici app for production. By following the migration guide and updating code systematically, we can complete this transition efficiently while maintaining functionality and code quality.
