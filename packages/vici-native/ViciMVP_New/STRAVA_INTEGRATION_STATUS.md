# Strava Integration Status Update

## Completed Tasks

### 1. Fixed ViewModel Initialization ✅

- Successfully removed direct dependency on `AuthViewModel.shared` in StravaConnectView
- Implemented `setAuthViewModel()` method to properly receive AuthViewModel from environment
- Updated onAppear lifecycle to set the AuthViewModel from environment object

### 2. Enhanced Loading States ✅

- Added granular loading state properties to ViewModel:
  - `isCheckingConnection`
  - `isConnecting`
  - `isDisconnecting`
  - `isSyncing`
- Updated UI to show appropriate loading indicators based on these states
- Improved button state management (disabling, opacity changes during loading)

### 3. Improved Error Handling ✅

- Implemented specialized `handleStravaError()` method for better error messages
- Added type-specific error handling for various Strava error cases
- Replaced generic errors with specific StravaError types

### 4. Added Debug Tooling ✅

- Added debug controls to simulate different error states in debug builds
- Included buttons to test:
  - Connection errors
  - Authentication errors
  - Network errors

### 5. Activity Sync Implementation ✅

- Added `syncStravaActivities()` method to ViewModel
- Properly integrated with loading state management
- Improved error handling for sync operations

### 6. API Endpoint Verification ✅

- Verified all StravaService API endpoints match our expected endpoints:
  - `/strava/connection/{userId}` (GET, DELETE)
  - `/strava/auth-url/{userId}` (GET)
  - `/strava/exchange-token` (POST)
  - `/strava/activities/{userId}` (GET)
- Updated Constants to match actual usage:
  - Changed from `/api/v1/strava` to `/strava` to match actual endpoint structure
- Added `constructEndpoint()` helper method to ensure consistent endpoint construction
- Updated all endpoint references to use the helper method

## Next Steps

### 1. Test OAuth Flow

- [ ] Verify URL scheme configuration in Info.plist
- [ ] Test AppDelegate URL handling
- [ ] Verify notification posting and handling

### 2. Testing

- [ ] Test with network disconnected
- [ ] Test with valid Strava credentials
- [ ] Test error states
- [ ] Verify loading indicators display correctly

## Remaining Issues

1. Need to verify that the Strava OAuth callback URL scheme is properly configured
2. Need to test the entire flow with real credentials

## Timeline

- Test and debug OAuth flow: 1 day
- Comprehensive testing with real credentials: 1 day
