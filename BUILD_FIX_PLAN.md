# BUILD_FIX_PLAN.md - ViciMVP Project Clean-up Tracker

## Overview

This document tracks our systematic approach to resolve build errors in the ViciMVP project, specifically focusing on duplicate file declarations causing "invalid redeclaration" errors. This plan will serve as a reference throughout the clean-up process.

## Root Cause Analysis

The primary issue appears to be duplicate files and symbols scattered across different directories:

- **ViewModels**: Multiple versions of AuthViewModel.swift, TrainingPlanViewModel.swift in:
  - ViciMVP/ViewModels/
  - temp-backup/FixedImports/
  - backup_20250414161447/
  - packages/vici-native/ViciMVP_New/ViciMVP/ViewModels/

- **Services**: Duplicate KeychainService.swift and APIClientProtocol.swift files

- **Views**: Multiple ProfileView.swift and TrainingPlanView.swift files in ViciMVP/Views/ and backup folders

- **Application Structure**: The Sources/ directory contains an older structure (Sources/Mocks/, Sources/Views/) with potentially conflicting models and an alternative entry point

When Xcode compiles, it encounters these duplicate definitions leading to "invalid redeclaration" and "ambiguous use of" errors.

## Clean-up Plan

### Phase 1: Preparation and Safety Measures ✅ (Completed)

- [x] **Version Control Setup**:
  - [x] Ensure entire project is committed to Git
  - [x] Create dedicated branch: `git checkout -b cleanup/duplicate-files`

- [ ] **Backup (Optional)**:
  - [ ] Create full manual backup of project folder if not using Git

- [x] **Document Current State**:

## Root Cause Findings

We have identified the root cause of the "Invalid redeclaration of 'APIClientProtocol'" error:

1. There were two declarations of the same protocol:
   - The main declaration in `ViciMVP/Services/APIClientProtocol.swift`
   - A duplicate declaration at the bottom of `ViciMVP/Services/APIClient.swift`

2. The duplicate declaration in APIClient.swift was likely a remnant from a previous fix attempt, as evidenced by the comment above it that said: `// Add protocol conformance back`

3. By removing the duplicate declaration, we were able to resolve the build error without needing to delete any folders or files from the filesystem.

4. **New Finding**: We also discovered and fixed an additional duplicate `APIClientProtocol` declaration in the test files:
   - The file `ViciMVPTests/StravaServiceTests.swift` contained another declaration of `APIClientProtocol`
   - This was unnecessary since the tests already have access to the main protocol via `@testable import ViciMVP`
   - We have commented out this duplicate declaration to prevent future conflicts

5. **Additional Protocol Duplication**: Our comprehensive audit identified another duplicate protocol definition:
   - The `KeychainServiceProtocol` was declared both in the dedicated `KeychainServiceProtocol.swift` file (correct)
   - And in the `MockKeychainService.swift` file (incorrect duplicate)
   - We commented out the duplicate declaration in the mock service file to ensure there's only one definition

## Redundant Directories to Remove

| Directory | Contents | Action |
|-----------|----------|--------|
| Sources/ | Old version of app structure | Remove - contains outdated architecture |
| temp-backup/ | Temporary backup files | Remove - minor differences noted in AuthViewModel.swift |
| backup_20250414161447/ | Backup files | Remove - older versions of current files |
| FixedFiles_Backup/ | Fixed versions of files | Remove - workarounds no longer needed |
| packages/ | Internal package directory | Check dependencies before removal |
| ViciMVP.xcodeproj.bak_* | Backup project files | Remove - backup project files |

## Lessons Learned

1. **Duplicate Declarations Can Be Subtle**: The "Invalid redeclaration" error was caused by a duplicate protocol declaration that wasn't immediately obvious because it was at the bottom of a large file.

2. **Commented Code Can Cause Issues**: The duplicate declaration was commented with "Add protocol conformance back", suggesting it was meant to be temporary or a reminder, but was accidentally left in the codebase.

3. **Clean Project Structure Doesn't Guarantee Clean Code**: Despite having a clean project structure with no visible external references or duplicates in the build phases, there was still a code-level issue.

4. **Systematic Approach Works**: Our methodical approach to examining the project structure and then the code itself helped us identify and fix the root cause.

## Ongoing Maintenance Tasks (April 17, 2024) ✅

Following the resolution of the main build issues, we've continued to clean up the codebase:

- [x] **Redundant/Temporary Files Removal**:
  - [x] Deleted `Test.swift` from Models directory (redundant/test file)
  - [x] Deleted `SimpleAuthViewModel.swift` (temporary implementation replaced by full AuthViewModel)
  - [x] Deleted `StravaConnectView_Previews.swift` (standalone preview file made redundant by embedded #Preview in main file)

- [x] **View Model Consolidation**:
  - [x] Identified redundancy between `UserViewModel.swift` and `ProfileViewModel.swift`
  - [x] Enhanced `ProfileViewModel` to include email update functionality 
  - [x] Deleted `UserViewModel.swift` (functionality now in ProfileViewModel)

- [x] **Mock Implementation Cleanup**:
  - [x] Identified duplicate mock implementations in main app target
  - [x] Removed `MockAuthService.swift` from main app folder (kept in test target)
  - [x] Removed `MockKeychainService.swift` from main app folder
  - [x] Ensured proper separation of test code from main application code

## Comprehensive Protocol Audit

To ensure there were no remaining declaration issues that could cause build problems, we conducted a systematic audit of all protocol declarations in the codebase:

1. **Files Examined**:
   - All Swift files in the project were searched for protocol declarations using `grep`
   - Special attention was paid to files with *Protocol.swift naming patterns
   - We also inspected test files that might contain duplicate declarations

2. **Issues Found and Fixed**:
   - `APIClientProtocol` was declared in three places:
     - Main declaration in `APIClientProtocol.swift` (kept)
     - Duplicate in `APIClient.swift` (removed)
     - Duplicate in `StravaServiceTests.swift` (commented out)
   - `KeychainServiceProtocol` was declared in two places:
     - Main declaration in `KeychainServiceProtocol.swift` (kept)
     - Duplicate in `MockKeychainService.swift` (commented out)

3. **Other Protocols Verified**:
   - `AuthServiceProtocol` - Only declared once in `AuthService.swift`
   - `StravaServiceProtocol` - Only declared once in `StravaService.swift`
   - `AuthViewModelProtocol` - Only declared once in `AuthViewModelProtocol.swift`

4. **Safe Implementation Pattern**:
   - For future development, we recommend using the pattern of defining protocols in dedicated files with clear naming conventions
   - Mock implementations should use the main protocol via import rather than declaring their own versions
   - Tests should use `@testable import ViciMVP` to access protocols rather than redefining them

This comprehensive audit confirms that all protocol declarations are now properly organized without duplications that could cause build errors.

## Phase 7: Code Consistency Implementation Completion

The implementation phase for code consistency has been successfully completed. This comprehensive refactoring effort has unified the codebase around standardized patterns for error handling, asynchronous operations, and UI feedback.

This standardization effort represents a significant milestone in the project's evolution, establishing a solid foundation for future development while addressing the immediate goal of creating a more maintainable and consistent codebase.

## Phase 8: Resolving Build Errors Post-Cleanup

After our successful reorganization and cleanup efforts, we now have a cleaner codebase that has resolved the primary "Invalid redeclaration of APIClientProtocol" error. However, the build process now reveals a series of new errors related to our implementation. These errors are primarily related to code implementation rather than structural issues, which is a sign of progress.

### Error Categories Identified

1. **BaseViewModel Implementation Issues**:
   - "Cannot find type 'BaseViewModel' in scope" in multiple ViewModels
   - "'super' members cannot be referenced in a root class"
   - Missing methods like 'runTask', 'handleError', and 'logger'

2. **Missing Model Preview Extensions**:
   - "Type 'Workout' has no member 'sampleWorkout'"
   - "Type 'TrainingPlan' has no member 'samplePlan'"
   - "Type 'Activity' has no member 'sampleActivity'"
   - "Type 'User' has no member 'previewUsers'"

3. **Remaining Redeclaration Issues**:
   - "Invalid redeclaration of 'AppDelegate'"
   - "Invalid redeclaration of 'stravaCallbackReceived'"
   - "Invalid redeclaration of 'stravaCallbackFailed'"

4. **Protocol Conformance Issues**:
   - "Type 'AuthViewModel' does not conform to protocol 'AuthViewModelProtocol'"
   - "Argument type 'KeychainService' does not conform to expected type 'KeychainServiceProtocol'"
   - "Generic struct 'StateObject' requires that 'ViewModel' conform to 'ObservableObject'"
   - Type 'Any' does not conform to protocol 'Decodable'

5. **Method Reference and Implementation Issues**:
   - "'async' call in a function that does not support concurrency"
   - "Call can throw, but it is not marked with 'try' and the error is not handled"
   - "Value of type 'any AuthServiceProtocol' has no member 'getCurrentUser'"
